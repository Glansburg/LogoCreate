# LogoCreate
## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make a logo generator for a possible company that would need a quick logo with 3 characters on it. This program would save me time on logo creation. 
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* How to better use inquirer
* How to better use constructor functions
* how to make classes and using "this" more clearly
* how to import Npm's

  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* running out of time to complete the testing suites.
 ## Instalation
N/A

## Usage
To view this app please watch this video of a demonstration of how the program works:
