## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make my own website for future employers to see, a work portfolio.  I did this by attempting to make a page that would share my big projects in the future.  This was a very difficult task for me.
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* How to add background images to sections
* How cascading works in css.
* different CSS formating.
* That CSS can be tricky.
* That time invested was time well spent and I learned more. The only problem was I was not able to complete the challenge in the amount of time I was given.
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* Just not understanding how I was able to move some things on the page and other things I could not.
* Just not understanding why certain images would not be added to my screen when i coded them in.
* Just not understanding the logic behind CSS?
* Biggest challenge was having things appear on the screeen when i wanted them to.
